    "The dataset gathers information regarding chess games on the [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has been retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adityajha1504/chesscom-user-games-60000-games). It's composed of a 160MB .csv file, which contains 14 columns and 66.879 rows.\n",

    "- username and ELO score of both players\n",
    "- which player has won\n",
    "- type of victory/draw (i.e. victory by checkmate or time)\n",

    "## Analysis goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial questions I've planned to respond to when starting this analysis are the following:\n",
    "- How is ELO distributed among players?\n",
    "- What are the most common opening moves? \n",
    "- How do openings change at different ELO ranges?\n",
    "- How many turns is an average game?\n",
    "- How does the time format influence the number of turns and the piece advantage between players?\n",
    "- Do high ELO players end the game with a lower or higher piece advantage on average?\n",
    "- What are the most common result types overall (i.e. win by checkmate, win by timeout, draw by stalemate, etc)? Are these influenced by ELO and time format?\n",
    "\n",
    "Further questions may emerge during the analysis depending on what I discover."
