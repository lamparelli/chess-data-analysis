    "The dataset gathers information regarding chess games on the [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has been retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adityajha1504/chesscom-user-games-60000-games). It's composed of a 160MB .csv file, which contains 14 columns and 66.879 rows.\n",

    "\n",
    "The initial questions I've planned to respond to when starting this analysis are the following:\n",
    "- How is ELO distributed among players?\n",
    "- What are the most common opening moves? \n",
    "- How do openings change at different ELO ranges?\n",
    "- How many turns is an average game?\n",
    "- How does the time format influence the number of turns and the piece advantage between players?\n",
    "- Do high ELO players end the game with a lower or higher piece advantage on average?\n",
    "- What are the most common win/draw conditions overall? Are these influencede by ELO and time format?\n",
